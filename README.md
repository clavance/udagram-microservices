## Refactor Monolith to Microservices

This project refactors the monolithic Udagram application into microservices. The project originally consisted of frontend and backend servers. These have been deconstructed into the following microservices:

1. Frontend
2. Backend feed - /api/v0/feed endpoint
3. Backend users - /api/v0/user endpoint
4. Reverse proxy - for clients to communicate with a single endpoint, using nginx

The repo is set up for automatic builds on Travis CI on a merge to master. Each microservice is deployed in a Docker container. The entire application is orchestrated with Kubernetes, using AWS EKS.

### Kubernetes
* To verify Kubernetes pods are deployed properly
A screenshot of `kubectl` commands show the Frontend and API projects deployed in Kubernetes.
The output of `kubectl get pods` indicates that the pods are running successfully with the STATUS value `Running`.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

* To verify Kubernetes services are properly set up
The output of `kubectl describe services` does not expose any sensitive strings such as database passwords.
`kubectl get secrets` above shows that sensitive strings are configured using the `secrets.yaml` file.

```bash
kubectl describe services
```

Kubernetes services are replicated. At least one of the Kubernetes services has `replicas:` defined with a value greater than 1 in its `deployment.yml` file.

There are 2 udagram-frontend endpoints shown in `kubectl describe services udagram-frontend`, reflecting the fact that 2 replicas of the frontend have been deployed.

* To verify that you have horizontal scaling set against CPU usage
```bash
kubectl describe hpa
```

* To verify that you have set up logging with a backend application

Making a call to an API in the backend feed pod:

Showing database response and logged activity on an API call:
```bash
kubectl logs {pod_name}
```

## Instructions for Backend API
* To download all the package dependencies, run the command from the directory `udagram-api/`:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
* To run the application locally, run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
* You can visit `http://localhost:8080/api/v0/feed` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a JSON payload. Feel free to play around with Postman to test the API's.

## Instructions for Frontend App
* To download all the package dependencies, run the command from the directory `udagram-frontend/`:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
* Install Ionic Framework's Command Line tools for us to build and run the application:
    ```bash
    npm install -g ionic
    ```
* Prepare your application by compiling them into static files.
    ```bash
    ionic build
    ```
* Run the application locally using files created from the `ionic build` command.
    ```bash
    ionic serve
    ```
* You can visit `http://localhost:4200` in your web browser to verify that the application is running. You should see a web interface.
